Main idea : using graph going up instead of number go up
Prestige idea : changing the scale like logarithmicing it

Could start like this :
- graph that goes up
- upgrades to add ui
- Upgrade cost preview on the main graph screen instead of numbers
- add other graphs like derivation for the speed, a histogram, a mathematical graph, usages unknown

Also cute characters and funny lines. Maybe even real narration?
