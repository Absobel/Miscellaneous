According to [[Huhuman, "The Children of Grinneal"]]:
- Man-at-arm of [[Luathas|Finach]] for 30 years
- recruited from [[Comhal]] city guards after he saved a group of children from a bull without harming the latter
- "Laidh was a tall and imposing figure. His hair was kept short, and while it contained a fair amount of grey, it still had a hint of its original black in places. A neatly-kept beard framed his square jaw, and his brown eyes suggested an intelligence that was belied by his great size."
- "Standing nearly seven feet tall, Laidh was a giant of a man, with arms like steel cables"
- Returned to [[Comhal]] to serve the next [[Grand Scholar]]
