Happens during the [[Third Aeon]]

There were the [[First Aosda]]. They referred to themselves as "Children of [[Temuair|Grinneal]]".

[[First Aosda]] lived for 20'000 years, then vanished. Then was rediscovered as the [[Second Aosda]] 6'000 years after. Then it survived 5'000 years into the [[Danaan Era]] to the appearance of the [[Tuatha de Danaan]], then vanished again. Even [[Hy-brasyl]] knew nothing about that.

This story comes from a volume about [[Hy-brasyl]] folk tales in [[Loures Castle Library]], it was written in Aosdan by [[Jaalyn Sarag]] in the hopes that the knowledge of the first civilization could live on.

Foreword written by [[Jean]] (the story is translated by him)

### 1 - Discovery

This story takes place in [[Comhal]] capital of [[First Aosda]] central of the central continent that made up [[Temuair|Grinneal]].
[[Fiosachd|Luathas]] is a thief during those times. He got caught.
Partner with [[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]]
They knocked out the guard that caught him.
Communicates with a hammer and a mallet with his partner.
[[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]] is caught
[[Fiosachd|Luathas]] flees.

### 2 - Repentance

There is a [[Palace of Justice]] in [[Comhal]] built at the start of the [[Second Aeon]]. An [[Adjudicator]] would be the judge for those who broke the law. Often a scholar picked by the [[Aosdic Council]] who themselves were the most sage scholars. Led by a [[Grand Scholar]]. This Council is revered cause it's thanks to them this society even exists. They held meetings in the [[University]]. 
They are the two most important buildings in [[Comhal]]
No one killed ~={orange}(or it was always hidden)=~ but those who broke the law exiled to northern region of [[Kadath]]. They never returned.

[[Adjudicator]] garbs : "orange robes adorned with intricate gold trim and, over the top, a grey overcoat with a high collar. In his left hand he wielded an iron sphere roughly the size of a fist, embossed with a trader’s scales – the symbol of his office."
[[Gramail|The Adjudicator of this story]] is at least a few hundred years old.

[[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]] gets sentenced to exil to [[Kadath]] and is sent to the catacombs
He doesn't snitch on [[Fiosachd|Luathas]] his friend

### 3 - Ascension

[[Fiosachd|Luathas]] and his friend had stole [[The Tome of Ascension|a book]] apparently mysterious from the pawnbroker. [[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]] supposedly had been given the intel by a trusted source.
“To you who have found this tome, know that alongside the path to ascension is the path to madness.”

### 4 - Premonition

Current [[Grand Scholar]] [[Luathas|Finach]] at the time of this story wants to try [[Ascension]] to exchange exp and knowledge for power. [[Unnamed Previous Grand Scholar]] only one to have tried it before ~={orange}(they have no way to know tbh)=~ and failed miserably, his mortal form annihilated and mind lost to darkness. [[Luathas|Finach]] thought the more knowledge and discipline would give him the best chances to keep [[Kadath]] at bay. He also foresaw himself winning.
[[Luathas|Finach]] is an [[Augur]], a person gifted with the gift of foresight, small visions who guided him to this point.
Wants a last vision before the ritual. He burned smth
Dreams of the fall of a golden city ~={orange}(which one i wanna ask)=~, then sees eight figures ~={orange}(the eight gods certainly)=~ fighting against darkness.

### 5 - Premonition

The book's name is [[The Tome of Ascension]]. last third of the book incoherent ramblings full of madness. Probably cause the guy attempted [[Ascension]].
The ritual is as follows : going to the peak mountain of [[Kadath]], making a sacrifice to the [[Earth-Sea Gods]] of [[Kadath]], then if found worthy, they would be granted powers from their accumulated experience (toiseach), and be reborn with more powers, "a god in their own right".
A name of the god is a word of power. The ascendant with be granted a god-name, etched on the altar of their rebirth. "It is this name through which supplicants may invoke the ascendant’s power, and which forms the basis of their status as a deity."
Then warned of [[Kadath]] and fell into its darkness.

[[Fiosachd|Luathas]] was reading this book at [[Cthon]], northernmost city before [[Kadath]].  He was going to search for [[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]]
[[Luathas|Finach]] also arrived there, wanting to become a god of wisdom and logic. His man-at-arms [[Laidh]] accompanying him. 
[[Luathas|Finach]] had resigned his position of [[Grand Scholar]]
He ventured on his own to [[Kadath]]
Highest peak name : [[Kedarnath]]
Apparently great winter wolves live there.

### 6 - [[Fiosachd]]

Wagon where [[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]] found destroyed by lightning (a lightning storm was brewing for a while)
Trail to [[Kedarnath]] is said to have been built by the first [[Earth-Sea Gods]] ascending
Fresh footprints from the trail. One with a walking stick
Found [[Harlan of River's Bend|Harlan]] and his gaolers walking in unisson side by side Thin shadow envelopping them as a whole
Laughter can be heard
Couldn't be moved, slowly advancing

On the top is an altar. [[Luathas|Finach]] sacrifies in it a purple hair ~={orange}(succubus hair?)=~
[[Fiosachd|Luathas]] arrives, [[Luathas|Finach]] gets thunderbolted and ascends. The name [[Fiosachd]] appears on the altar. Then he gets thunderbolted too.
Orbs form atop the altar, and the new god rebirths from that.
