——————

[[First Aeon]] | **Grinneal 1 - 9000**
_"The first [[Grinneal Era|Grinneal]]"_

It is believed that writing came from the [[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilisation.
Probably didn't preserve knowledge because of life conditions.
[[Mundanes]] probably appeared in some fashion during the next 9000 years.
They were ignorant still of the [[Elements]].
[[First Aosda|Aosda]] rose around the end of the [[First Aeon]] and the beginning of the next.

[[Second Aeon]]: Madness | **Grinneal 9000 - 15000**
*"The discovery of [[Kadath]]. Discovery of the [[Earth-Sea Gods]] ... Entreaty of the [[Other Gods]]"*

[[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilisation, first scholars, [[Mundanes]] began questioning the world, etc.
Discovered [[Gods]]. Good and evil.
They looked [[Kadath|north]], madness spread. Darkness, eldritch, etc. Chaos spread.
The survivors looked towards other directions : they discovered the [[Earth-Sea Gods]].
The [[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilization as now hurt, art depicted darker things, they looked away from the [[Kadath|north]].

200 years later, they started leeching powers from those higher entities. Studied it. Tried to tame it. Chaining lesser entities. Some built temples to gain favor.
This drew the rage of the [[Earth-Sea Gods|gods]].

[[Third Aeon]]: Bliss | **Grinneal 15000 - 22000?**
_"Death of all those who knew of [[Kadath]]. [[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilization lost"_

Several interpretations.
Now confident, looked to the north again. Found stronger powers, and unleashed them.
Some say darkness hid in their mind, waiting.
Others says that it was not hidden at all and returned wanting destruction.
[[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilisation ended, either because of the darkness from [[Kadath]], or because the [[Earth-Sea Gods]] purged the land.

[[Fourth Aeon]]: Innocence | **Grinneal 22000? - 26900**
_"Mundane work with little progress"_

Mostly peace, no knowledge of what happened before and no exploration whatsoever.

[[Fifth Aeon]]: Discovery | **Grinneal 26900 - 32092**

[[Mundanes]] started to explore again, search again.
Their findings fell into four groups : [[Fire]], [[Water]], [[Earth]] and [[Wind]]. The first [[Elements]].
They remembered the legends of the [[First Aosda]] civilisation, and decided to reenact it. It became the [[Second Aosda]] civilization.

[[Sixth Aeon]]: Purity | **Danaan 1 - 1101**

A new race came from the sea and arrived to the known world. They were the [[Tuatha de Danaan]], or Children of the Goddess Danu. Many claim they were what brought [[Light|light]].
With their coming, "the elements danced in delight", their wisdom spread to the mundanes and merged to the preserved lore of the [[First Aosda]].
