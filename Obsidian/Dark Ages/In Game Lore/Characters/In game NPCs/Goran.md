"Harvest Cherries"
> I've got a lots of sweet [[Cherry|cherries]] you can pick. YOu can pick a dozen cherries for a few coins for my trouble.

"No thanks"
> Well, so be it. I'll be off to my chores if you don't mind.

*(end of discussion)*

"Why is your home wrecked?"
*He looks saddened*
> My [[Goran's family|family]] had no wealth. Why did they have to come and take what I had? Because my family fought against them. [[Loures]] soldier were in for a surprise when our family appeared at [[Undine]]. We gave [[Loures]] something to remember us by.
> So the court of [[Loures]] has intimidated me ever since. They've ruined my home and driven off my friends. That is, all the one they didn't kill.
> [[Bertil]] took compassion on me, and helped my crops to grow. Now I have mu revenge on [[Loures]].
> [[Ardmagh]], which [[Loures]] is the capital of, is the only climate for ripening [[Cherry|cherries]]. But [[Bertil]] blessed my land, and I grow lush [[Cherry|cherries]]. [[Loures]]? Bah!

"Why would I want to pick cherries"
*He looks at you indifferently*
> Well, li'l [[Aislings|Aisling]], [[Cherry|cherries]] are delicious. That's plenty enough reason. Besides that, there are [[Priest|priests]] who can take cherries and [[Grapes|grapes]] and gently mix them up on [[Faerie|faerie]] ground. So? So, the cherries and grapes form a potion that will revive someone who is bleeding to death beside you.

"How do I pick cherries?"
*He smiles, revealing the hard marks life has left on him*
> Out in the field, be careful not to step onto the green crops. Walk on the dirt paths between the plants, and you can easily spot and pick the cherries.

"Yes"
> A rich and powerful [[Aislings|Aisling]] such as yourself. Why that'll be 1000 coins to pick three dozen of the finest [[Cherry|cherries]] from my field. That cheaper than you can buy them for, I'll have you know.

"No thanks"
*(again same refusal message and end of discussion)*

"Okay, I'll pay that"
*He lets you into the field*
*(tp onto the field)*

*(if you walk on the crops)*
*The farmer grabs you*
*The famer tries to grab ... more coins and throws you out*
> Don't go damaging my crops... TODO idk didn't read fast enough


"Porte Forest" ~={orange}Move this to Quest Porte Forest or smth?=~
> Hmm.. You want to hear about [[Porte Forest]]? ~={orange}*(pink text)*=~ That's not a place for camping or picnic. [[Porte Forest]] has a scent of evil to it, it does. As long as I can remember that place has ben as inviting as a rodent's nest.
> None of us here have any business with [[Porte Forest]]. I don't know why they built a bridge back to that cursed place.
> As stories tell us, it wasn't always such a dangerous place; They say folks used to live out there with their families, coming into town quite regularly to trade and gossip. I suppose you'll be wanting to hear how all that changed, eh?
> My old [[Goran's Grandfather|Grandpap]] once sat me down and told me all about [[Porte Forest]]. It's an old, sad story...
> A man used to live out in the forest with his wide and daughter. This man loved the forest. He built his house out of fallen trees, wouldn't cut any down by himself. He walked every inch of the place. He even had a genuine map-maker come ask his help to map it! I don't know what the man's name was. [[Goran's Grandfather|Pap]] never told me. I suppose all their names are lost to time.
> Story goes, one day this man wandered into a hidden glade, deep in the woods to find a beautiful stone lying on a bed of golden leaves.
> He was amazed that such a wonderous stone would be seated in the middle of the forest. Not realising the signifigance of the alter that he found, he took the stone back to his house and tied it with a strip of leather, as a necklace for his daughter's birthday.
> That was when things begun to change in the [[Porte Forest|forest]]. The animals stopped coming out to peek at the village. The birds stopped their cheerful songs. The bright clearings became dark and gloomy. From that day on, the forest was a dark and haunted place. Fewer and fewer [[Aislings|aislings]] would venture in further than the eaves to collect firewood. Only the few folk who lived in the forest would brave the trails, and even then, never at night. The forest bore the taint of anger, of evil.
> On the daughter's birthday, she recieved her gift with such joy that not even the gloom of the forest could dampen the day. The man, his wife and his daughter celebrated her coming of age long into the night. But the next day, the man woke to find his daughter missing. She was nowhere to be found. He called out for her to come in. But she did not.. The man waited all day, and all night for her to return. But she did not..
> Late in the night, the man's wife pleaded with him to go out in search of her, to find her and bring her back home. So the man left the safety of his home to wander trough [[Porte Forest]], calling for his daughter.
> But the forest had changed. The familiar trails disappeared as he passed by. Beady, hateful eyes stared at him from the brush. He lost his way soon after he left his house. It is said that he wandered far into the deep wood in search of his daughter.
> Neither the man, nor his daughter ever returned home.

"What happened to his wife?"
> No one really knows... Some say the wife was so distraught that she took her own life. Others say she followed her husband to her death. Some optimists say she simply left [[Suomi]], to start a new life.

"What happened next?"
> What happened next? Why, that's all there is! It's just a story that my pappy used to tell me to keep me inside during nighttime. ((Mention the forest to other merchants of [[Suomi]]))
