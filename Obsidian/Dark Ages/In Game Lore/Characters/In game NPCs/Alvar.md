"Harvest Grapes"
> I have a vineyard of grapes that my quaint home faces. I'll let you pick up to eighteen grapes for this three days. I need to keep them growing.

"No, thanks"
> Goodbye then. Sorry, I don't have any samples of wine. Try at the tavern.

"Tell me a little about your vineyard"
> I've been a farmer since I can remember, and [[Alvar's father|my father]] before me too. We're the best at what we do.
> Recently [[Goran]] pleaded with me to open my vineyard to [[Aislings]]. I was skeptical, and still keep a sharp eye, but I agreed to it. [[Goran]] is a good man. He's had a hard life. It's not fair what [[Loures]] court had done to him.
> I applaud his courage. It's more than I have. I am lucky to have the best soil in [[Suomi]]. I have a very comfortable and stable vineyard, with no troubles from [[Loures]] as long as [[Suomi]] is strong.

"Where is [[Goran]], the cherry farmer?"
> [[Goran]] is also in [[Suomi]]. His farm is north of the main [[Suomi]] bridge and all the way west. It's beside the [[Faerie|faerie]] priestess's home, to [[Goran]]'s good luck!

"Why would I want to pick graphes?"
> Well I sell it to make wine for [[Mundanes|mundanes]]. For [[Aislings]], there are [[Priest|priests]] who can take [[Cherry|cherries]] and [[Grapes|grapes]] and gently mix them upon [[Faerie|faerie]] ground. The [[Cherry|cherries]] and [[Grapes|grapes]] form a portion that will revive someone who is bleeding to death beside you. Ask a knowledgeable priest about it.
> And pick some grapes and cherries for the [[Priest|priest]].

"How do I pick grapes?"
> Out in the field, be careful not to step onto the green crops. Walk on the dirt paths between the plants, and you can easily spot and pick the grapes.

"Yes"
> That amounts to 100 coins. I'll accept any currency.

"No thanks"
*(again same refusal message and end of discussion)*

"Okay, I'll pay that"
*He lets you into the field*
*(tp onto the field)*

*(if you step on the plants)*
> Don't step on the plants, this is my life and blood.
*(or smth like that too lazy to try again)*
