> Chadul is an abomination. Do not mention that name! [[Chadul]] is a slumbering being which must never be disturbed. It has struck [[Temuair]] and torn it assunder. It is a vile, writhing chaos of ultimate darkness. The [[Dubhaim|dubhaim]] are mere fragments of [[Chadul]]. When the [[Elements|element]] of [[Darkness (Element)]] was discovered, the key to reaching [[Chadul]] was made; It was the gravest mistake ever made.
