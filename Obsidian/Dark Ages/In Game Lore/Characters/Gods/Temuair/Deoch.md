Mundane description :
> [[Deoch]] was originally the god of debauchery. He was a [[Dubhaim]] god, born from the [[Shadows War|Great War between Danaan and Chadul]]. It was after the [[Shadows War]] that something miraculous occured. [[Deoch]] fell in love with [[Danaan]].
> Some belive that [[Deoch]] gave the element of [[Light (Element)|Light]] to [[Humanity|humanity]]. It is certain that the first Spring after the [[Sacrifice of Danaan]], [[Deoch]] carried on Her work. [[Deoch]] created the first [[Aislings|Aisling]] in the Fall of the same year. In honor of Him, we date our calendar.

Every light casts a shadow, and behind every shadow lurks the Light.
