"Introduction"
> The [[Elements|elements]] compose everything. Everything has combinations of the [[Elements|elements]]. A [[Wizard|wizard]] wields them in their purer forms.
> An element is not only a physical manifestation. It is spiritual and emotional. [[Fire|Srad]] feels exciting. [[Wind|Athar]] feels analytical. [[Earth|Creag]] feels stable. [[Water|Sal]] feels empathic and engrossing.

History
> In the olden days of [[Hy-brasyl]], the [[tuatha de danaan]], 'Children of the Goddess of Light', danced with the elements. The elements enveloped mortals and existed in harmony. The tuatha learned to harness the elements. From this, the magic we know and wield sprang.

[[Fire|srad]]
> Srad
> Arcane fire
> Srad is hot, quick and dry. It begins things.
> It has no staying power.
> Srad dominates athar

[[Wind|athar]]
> Athar
> Arcane air
> Athar is fast and nimble.
> It is often cruel, while eating away.
> Athar dominates creag

[[Earth|creag]]
> Creag
> Arcane earth
> Creag is stable. It is slow to move.
> It is, therefore, confident and traditional.
> Creag dominates sal.

[[Water|sal]]
> Sal
> Arcane water
> Sal is fluid, accepting.
> It is enduring and immortal.
> When opposed it gives way and envelopes.
> It smothers and drowns, sometimes with
> kindness, sometimes with cruelty.
> Sal reflects whatever looks into it.
> Sal dominates srad.

Relationships
> Every element is weak against itself.
> This is the cycle of elements:

> athar fas creag.
> creag fas sal.

Creatures
> Elements are the fabric of nature. Creatures are affected by different elements. There are several creatures which have been touched, or can touch the pure elements. This makes them very dangerous. You may find yourself assaulted by a wolf who summons a shock of athar upon you. However, knowing which element the creatures is kin to is your advantage. 
> Kinship is not always formed by species. Two members of a species may have different elements. Observe the creature. A [[Rogue|rogue]] is keener than our lot. The rogue can directly sense which element a creature belongs to.

Artifacts
> Necklaces, embued with an element, generally change the assault element of the wearer. Belts, embued with an element, generally change the defense element of the wearer.
