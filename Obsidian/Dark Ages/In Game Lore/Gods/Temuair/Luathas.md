Mundane description:
> [[Luathas]] is the god of gnosis: divine knowledge. [[Luathas]] is worshipped by seekers of lore and arcane knowledge, as well as those trying to make their way, wether lost in the woods, or lost in the hustle of a city's chaos, or lost without a purpose in life.
> [[Luathas]] was an [[Aosda]] that studied intensely and was touched by [[Danaan]] to study even more.

According to [[Huhuman, "The Children of Grinneal"]]:
- Previously named Finach
- He was a [[Grand Scholar]] in [[First Aosda]] that [[Ascension|ascended]] to become a god at the same time as [[Fiosachd]]. He aided the then [[Adjudicator]] to become [[Gramail]]
- He was an [[Augur]] and foresaw the fall of a golden city and the eight [[Gods of Temuair]] fighting together against darkness. He also got a lot of visions that got him to where he was.
	- He used meditation, exercises and burning a feather to get him in a divination state. ~={orange}(Unclear if it's inherent to his powers or just to get him in the mood)=~
