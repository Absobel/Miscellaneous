According to [[Huhuman, "The Children of Grinneal"]]:
- Previously named Luathas *(explains why swiftness)*, he was a thief that stole the [[The Tome of Ascension]] and [[Ascension|ascended]] in [[Kadath]] to become a god at the same time as [[Luathas]].
- He was a good friend with [[Harlan of River's Bend]] who got corrupted by [[Chadul]]'s darkness. [[Fiosachd]] transformed him in a crystal and put him in his pouch.
