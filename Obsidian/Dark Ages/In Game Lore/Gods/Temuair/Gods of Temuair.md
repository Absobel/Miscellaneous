### Octagram

> Allow me to arrange some pebbles into an octagram, and then correspond the deities to one point of the octagram. If you were to trace lines from each point, you would find the two allies. If you were to look at the neighbors of the octograms, you will find the enemies of that deity. Examine the allies and enemies of the gods and then consult the octagram.

> Each God is the head of a particular trinity. Their allies are the lesser members of the trinity. As the faith in the god, its allies grows, the strength of the god's influence grows. As the faith of the god's enemies grows, the god's influence wanes. The power of a priest is dependent on the god's influence. Faith grows with the initiate worshipers.
