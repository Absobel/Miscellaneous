[[Eeva]] book she shows for [[Quest - Perfect Hairstyle]]

"Braid"
> The standard braid is the common innkeeper hairstyle, both beautiful and modest. To achieve this, simply wash with two [[fior sal|fior sals]] and braid the hair over one shoulder, and to decorate, use a jade ring.

"Teased"
> For long, full-bodied hair, you must tease it thoroughly with a comb. Take a piece of [[Finished Coral|finished coral]] to make a comb to run through your lovely locks, and dust it with some [[Blue Powder|blue powder]] for shine.

"Straight"
> To get your lengthy locks under control, you require something to hold strong. Two pieces of [[Raw Wax|raw wax]] melted with a [[fior srad|fior]] will create the strongest product for taming those tresses.

"Wavy"
> If bouncy curls and sweeping waves are what you desire, seek out these ingredients: First gather one piece of [[Wolf skin|wolf skin]] to tear into strops and wrap your locks around. Then one [[fior srad]] and one [[fior athar]]. Mix them together, and release the hot air over your hair, for beautiful curls most fair.

"Ponytail"
> A small ponytail makes for a very modest hairstyle. To tie your hair back you need a lovely bow, weaved of five pieces of [[Spider silk|spider  s silk]].

"Bun"
> The bun is a stylish way to keep your hair up and out of the way. To hold the bun in place, just obtain a simple [[Magus Toque|magus]] or [[Holy Toque|holy toque]] and use the net. 

"Loops"
> For admirable loops in your hair, you will need a strong frame to twirl the hair around. Firm, but malleable is leather -- take a simple [[Leather Belt|leather belt]] and a [[Dirk|dirk]], and cut into strips to twirl the hair around.

"Twist"
> Combining braid and bun is a difficult style to create, that requires only technique. However, alone it is very plain, and requires a little sparkle woven into it. A [[Pearl Necklace|pearl necklace]], adorned with the lustrous gemstone of the seas will bring life to your locks. It is called a twist.
