	Table of Contents

Introduction
> Each point of a pentagram (a five-pointed star drawn with five lines without ever lifting the quill) is indicative of a supernatural essence.
> Warrior -->  Priest --> Monk --> Rogue --> Wizard
> 
> I cannot honestly express what drew me to this ritual. I do not recommend it to inexperienced. It is maddening! Even to the experienced, it could result in madness, death, or Unspeakable Horror.

Pact
> Only certain powerful souls can perform this ritual of the pentagram. The pact consists of: one [[Wizard|wizard]], one [[Warrior|warrior]], one [[Priest|priest]], one [[Monk|monk]], and one [[Rogue|rogue]]. Each must have three score insights and available time to perform the ritual.
> Each persons signs their name in sacred ink by the point of their proper place on the pentagram.
> The pact ends after one full day has passed from its first signature. With the pact ended, the ritual is impossible to continue. The [[Spirits|spirits]] will not respond, nor will any ritual magic work.

Location
> After each person has signed their name to the pact, they must quickly go to the sacred temple untouched by the outside air. I had sealed my temple underneath the floor of the first room of the first [[Macabre Study]]. Yet the wood above it rots, threatening to cave in.
> I keep a copy of the important parts of the ritual on my desk in the ritual room. I find it helpful for referring to.

Invocation
> Once arrived, carefully note the five points of the pentagram, which are marked by heads of [[Bone Collectors]]. Notice that the lines are not drawn. This each ritualist will do.
> Each member must stand at their given point at the pentagram. The [[Wizard|wizard]] to the south-west, the [[Warrior|warrior]] to the north, the [[Priest|priest]] to the south-east, the [[Monk|monk]] to the north-west, and the [[Rogue|rogue]] to the north-east.
> \[Pentagram drawing]
> Each member must not leave their position at the point. They hold the energies in balance.
> The [[Wizard|wizard]], without moving from his point, lays a hand-size portion of [[Zombi's Flesh]] exactly two paces in toward the center from where he stands at the point.
> If done correctly, a sickly candle will light before the ritualist. It's origin I would rather not write on, especially as it make certain readers uneasy and certain rulers uneasier.
> The candle is not necessary for the completion of the ritual. It is the first act the spirit takes to communicate with the living.
> The ritualist then walks along the line of the pentagram that is clockwise to the next point. In this method, the pentragram is drawn.
> For example, the [[Wizard]] now stands where the [[Warrior]] was. The [[Warrior]] now stands where the [[Priest]] was. The [[Priest]] stands where the [[Monk]] was. And the [[Monk]] stands where the [[Rogue]] had been.

Communion
> After invocation, the cursed spirit speaks at the next point of the pentagram.
> A confounding problem is that the spirits who communicated were mad and troubled. They spoke of their pasts but each spirit was forbidden to reveal their secrets.
> By way of the lines of the pentagram, the spirits speak. A spirit communes with the [[Warrior|warrior]] but it is not directly to him. It will be to the [[Priest|priest]], in this example, that the spirit must speak.
> Thus each ritualist is a medium of the spirits. In the case mentioned, the [[Warrior]] must tell the [[Priest]] what the spirit had said and divulge the proper sacred or cursed location to go to.
> The ritualists must each go to many such locations that are significant to the invoked spirits. The spirits are exact in their nostalgia. Going to the wrong location angers the supernatural creatures, making the communion hard.
> Always ask the spirit where to go to, and realize that the spirit is not speaking to you, but speaking through you. You are the medium that the spirit has chosen to talk to someone else performing the ritual.

Banishment
> After you are certain that you have performed communion along both lines of all the five lines of the pentagram, then banish the energies.
> Each member must stand at their given point at the pentagram. The [[Wizard|wizard]] to the south-west, the [[Warrior|warrior]] to the north, the [[Priest|priest]] to the south-east, the [[Monk|monk]] to the north-west, and the [[Rogue|rogue]] to the north-east.

> Each member must not leave their position at the point. They hold the energies in balance.
> The [[Wizard|wizard]], without moving from his point, lays a hand-size portion of [[Zombi's Flesh]] exactly two paces in toward the center from where he stands at the point.
> If correctly performed, the spirits dissipate. But if anything is awry, some Unspeakable Horror may enter the pentagram \[Monster from [[Chtonic Remains]]]. If so, it must be bound or destroyed immediately. After the creation is destroyed, then the banishment may be done again. That is: \[repeat up to pentagram drawing]
> I've heard accounts of ritualists being possessed forever by the spirits. Beware! These sad fellows grew, day by day, more like the horrors they had communion with until I could not thell them apart.

Notes
> I've intentionally removed the section of the pact that deals with the actual signing. If the [[Bruce|King]] or any should ask, I am his loyal subject. (However, who knows what rats might bring in the library)
