[[Anwar]]
> Like most stories, this began many [[Deoch Era|Deochs]] ago. I was just a wee lad. I lived with my family at the town near the center of the island.
> The name of the town slips me. I was too young to remember and no one dares speak its name, because of what happened.
> The town was like any other, like [[Piet]] or [[Mileth]]. Near the village there was a peak and at the top was a large mansion called [[Eingren Manor]].
> [[Old Eingren]] was a very wealthy [[Mundanes|Mundane]]. From what I have been told, he kept to himself most of the time and died before I was even born.
> His death befuddled the townsfolk. They realized something was awry when he stopped visiting the town. When they went to see what was wrong, all they could find was a pile of fresh skin in a pool of blood.
> As if he took it off like a piece of clothing. No bones, no organs, no meat. It was assumed he was eaten by some wretched creature that didn't like skin.
> For [[Old Eingren|Eingren]]'s funeral, the mortician just stuffed the skin suit with some grass to give it some volume.
> It sounds ridiculous, I know. It was a common ghost story parents would tell their child.
> Moving on, so after his death, a lady, blast it I forget her name. Some lady took over the [[Eingren Manor|Eingren mansion]]. Apparently it was granted to her in [[Old Eingren|Eingren]]'s will.
> She turned the mansion into an orphanage and became the [[Headmaster]].
> It was very charitable of her, orphaned children from all over [[Temuair]] came here.
> For many Deochs, everything was just fine. Until the townsfolk started to notice that some of the children were disappearing.
> The [[Headmaster]] said they ran away, and no one thought anything of it. Until one night, the night of the [[Red Moon]], a shrieking scream was heard through out the island.
> It awoken the entire town. A small group was sent to investigate. What they discovered was horrifying.
> Within the [[Headmaster]]'s quarters, they found piles of bones from all the children of the orphanage. The lady [[Headmaster]] killed herself in some strange ritual.
> [[Priest (Rank)|Priests]] from various temples came and sealed off the mansion.
> The center of the island became cursed. Everyone eventually left the town leaving it barren. No one really knows what happened there.
> That is all to the story, but there is one more thing.
> [[Anwar's father|My father]] was part of the group who went to investigate the mansion that night.
> He was already saddened by the loss of the children when he found a diary page in one of the rooms. He read it and it greived his heart even more.
> He took the page and brought it back. He told no one of it. I guess he wanted to always remember this tragic event.
> When the priests came to investigate the incident, he buried the diary page somewhere in this field.
> For some reason he never dug it back up. What ever he saw in that mansion changed him, he was never the same.
> Well, if you want, you can roam the field over there to look for the diary page, you might need it if you plan to go exploring [[Eingren Manor]].

(after roaming)
> You find a soft spot in the soil. Digging with your shovel you find a piece of paper writing.

Diary Page 1
> Today was my first day at the orphanage. I felt awkward at first, no used to meeting strangers. But the other children here are nice and friendly.
> For the first time I feel at home, ever since my parents died. The [[Headmaster]] seems very nice as well, but I get this strange feeling about her. I'm not sure why.
> This place is very big, it is very easy to get lost here. The paintings are very scary, I hate looking at them. But with [[Frankford]] by my side I have nothing to worry about.
