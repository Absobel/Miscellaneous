[[Marlin]]
> The tragedy of my imprisonment is that I miss [[Bella]]. Her coils of hair caught my heart years ago. It drives my dreadful dreams.

Who is [[Bella]]?
> [[Bella]] is my love, from whom am I separated. My life depends on a ribbon of parchment between us. I sneak out letters to her. I have no more. But I have a message. Will you tell her something?

Where is [[Bella]]?
> [[Bella]]? She's in [[Piet]] I assume. She is the barkeep of the tavern there. I haven't heard from her in over a season. [[Jean]] might know where to find her.

I will tell the message to [[Bella]].
> Thank you. The message is:
>
> Dear [[Bella]], [[Dark Maze|The Chamber]] blackens. It's maze twists deeper into my mind. Each turn reveals darker creatures that I hadn't realized dwelt within. Save me from this [[Sgrios|Sgriotic]] realm.
> 
> - Your love, [[Marlin]].
> 
> Take it to her now.

Why were you imprisoned?
> I was imprisoned for what I know. I have seen the blackness created by the uncaring hearts. I discovered where the maddening rock had lain for thousands of years.
> The [[Grimlok]] and [[Goblins]] battled over that [[Conix of Atavism]] since [[Deoch Era|Deoch]] 6. Cyril, the [[Councilor of Loures|councilor of Loures]], imprisoned me. [[Cyril]] is dead by horrors I dare not imagine. [[Jean]] is Councilor now.

What is the [[Conix]]?
> If I speak, I will lose my head. Go to the library.

What about the new [[Councilor of Loures|Councilor]], [[Jean]]?
> Often I used to see him in the [[Loures Castle Library|Library of Loures]], before recent events.

Does not [[Jean]] care you are imprisoned?
> He says he regrets my situation.

Does [[Jean]] know [[Bella]]?
> Yes. [[Bella]] visits him often. A guard tells me that she weeps for my release.

What Dreadful dreams?
> Black fluttering wings, like the pit of my heart, clutching my love. A red scarf recedes from me and [[Bella]]'s cry with it.

(before the quest)
> The transformation of [[Deoch]]'s hot intoxication into [[Glioca]]'s moonlit compassion reminds me of sweet [[Bella]] who used to visit me.

(after the quest)
> I'm happy for [[Marlin]], and sorry for him, too. He's loved. I don't know that i can ever say I've truly let go to love before. [[Marlin]] has.
> You've taught me to see love. I don't know what's to become of [[Marlin]], but the shell around my heart has been opened, and its precious content softened. For this brief moment,  I can see as the [[Aislings|Aisling]] does: love where there was only pain and desire, inspiration where there was only toil and suffering, compassion where there was only authority

Where is [[Bella]]?
> [[Bella]] walks, in deep consideration, at dusk and dawn in the [[Enchanted Garden|garden]].
> She told me the silliest of things.

What did she say?
> She told me that on a twilight walk in the garden she met a [[Faerie|faerie]].

Please tell me more
> She waited until dawn or dusk just north of the [[Lover's Glade]]. She patiently walked through the woods until she came a clearing of a betony flower, where she saw a red silk scarf. She waited.
> It was a [[Faerie|faerie]]. She held conversation with the faerie, who revealed that between midnight and dawn she danced there. Bella watched her dance several nights.

Do you love [[Bella]]?
> I would burn down the world for her. I would do anything for her. 

Would you release [[Marlin]]?
> I would release Marlin if Bella would bewed me. Gladly.


[[Enchanted Garden]] - (81,7)
> You notice what appears to be part of a silk red scarf.

Wait.
> You wait but nothing appears. Set down some Faerie Wine?

Yes.
> *peeks* Are all the [[Mundanes|mundanes]] away?

Hello.
> I see you seeing me. Dance with me. Wee.

I can't. 
> _The faerie putes a new freckle on your cheek_

(end of discussion)

Have you seen Bella?
> She danced with me. 

Where is she now?
> Dark, beating wings clutched her and carried her off! 


[[Marlin]]
> Did you give Bella the letter?

I found a faerie in the garden who said...
> My dream is true. A black-hearted creature has stolen my love. Please help me find her.

How can I help you?
> In the same dream that began with the black-winged creature swooping Bella away.

What then?
> Under a pillowless bed in [[Loures Castle|Loures castle]], a shadow opens up and swallows her. The shadow ebbs and flows in two minutes. Only during the even minute can one follow it.
> A chaotic maze and finally white circles that pulse to movement of the stars.
> A man and woman perform the rite of the first transformation that [[Jean]] barely understands. ~={orange}(What does the Conjunction between Deoch and Glioca has to do with this)=~

What do you think it means?
> At night I hear the pulse from below the castle. I dream of incongruous dark forms, slumbering. They slip from the shadows of the cracks in the stone, [[Dubhaim|dubhaimid]] seeping from [[Loures Castle|Loures castle]].
> This castle is built the site of something very old, and something that is now very powerful, and very dark.

I think I can do it.
> There is one more thing. Will you give her an additional message?

I'll tell her.
> Dear [[Bella]], though age claims my bones, though this cell claims my life, though poisonous thoughts claim my sanity, my heart is eternally with you. - Love, [[Marlin]]. 


[[Loures Castle Floor 1 Bedroom]]
> A large pulse moves beneath the stone.

Feel it

*get sent to the [[Dark Maze]]*
*then to the [[Heart of Stone]]*

> There is an ancient [[Aosda|Aosdic]] circle with inscriptions of two rituals. Which rite will you perform?

[[Conjunction]] of [[Deoch|The Flame]] & [[Glioca|The Moon]]
> The Flame will begin the ceremony by stepping into the circle.
> Whom shall you perform the rite with? One of you will begin as the Flame and the other will be the Moon.

I will perform the rite with another [[Aislings|Aisling]]
> Will you follow as the Moon in the Conjunction of the Flame and the Moon with ___?

I will be the Moon.
At this holy moment Jealous Fire becomes nourishing blood... 
...in soft moonlight.
As it is in divinity so is it in mortality. Fire's last breath...
...kindles love.
So may it be for [[Marlin]] & [[Bella]].
So may it be for all [[Aislings]]. 


[[Marlin]]
> I had another dream of [[Bella]]. She was close to me, smiling. You told her. Even though you never saw her directly, you met her. I know I'll meet her again soon, too. You've given me vision, [[Aislings|Aisling]].
