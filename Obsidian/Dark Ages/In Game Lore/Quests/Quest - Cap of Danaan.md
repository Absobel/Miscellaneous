[[Rolan]]
> You are an [[Aislings|Aisling]]? Oh thank [[Danaan]] you came. You must have heard my dreams. Every night it is the same. [[Glioca]], [[Cail]], [[Ceannlaidir]] and [[Luathas]] stand on one side, [[Gramail]], [[Deoch]], [[Fiosachd]], and [[Sgrios]] on the other side. And they're all wearing hats! It is so silly. They keep arguing between themselves, sometimes they talk to me, but I can't understand what they are saying! I can't stand it anymore, every night, every night... Please, [[Aislings|Aisling]], find out where this dream comes from, and help me get rid of it. Maybe the old books in [[Loures]] say something, but the guards did not let me in for some reason...


[[Blaise]]
> Ssshhh!! Quiet. You are here to help that boy in Abel, right?

Yes
> Don't be so loud. We received orders not to ever touch the subject, and the guards make sure the orders are followed.

///// PATH 1 //////

Do you know anything about the boy's dream?
> Not much. I remember seeing a book, long ago, where an old man wrote about having dreams similar to that boy's. But before I could look at it again, the soldiers took it away. I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

Why is the subject forbidden?
> I do not know. But it was [[Jean]] himself who relayed the orders to me. He said [[Loures]] cannot defy the will of its [[Gramail|patron deity]]. I wonder what [[Camille]] said in her recent visit to him. It is so rare for her to leave that temple down there, it must have been very important.

///// PATH 2 /////

Orders?
> Yes, from Jean himself. He said Loures cannot defy the wishes of four Gods. I wonder what he meant by that.

What did you find?
> Many generations ago, an old man had dreams similar to that boy's. No one took him seriously, but he kept records of those. One night, he understood what one of the Gods was saying.

What was said?
> It was something like this... "I still think they can have it, but I will agree to wait until a great trial is put upon them." That was all he understood. And he died not long after, so nothing else was recorded.

Which god?
> It was [[Ceannlaidir]] in the man's dream.

Can I see the records?
> I am afraid not. The guards took it away not long after I was done with it. If you need more information, you might want to speak with one to that God.

/////////////////

///// PATH 1 //////
[[Camille]]
> What can I do for you?

Do you know anything of [[Jean]]'s orders?
> [[Jean]]? Orders? I do not know what you are talking about. Sorry.

(End of dicussion)

Your skin is very nicely tanned.
> Thank you. I vent to the beaches of [[Abel]] recently, and after the job was done, I took some free time for myself.
> Nice, isn't it?

What job was there in Abel?
> Nothing important. They needed an [[Acolyte]] to identify something there, but [[Aundy]] was not available, so they invited me.
> The funny part, [[Aundy]] was here in [[Loures]] visiting that lonely girl in the [[Loures Castle|castle]]! I just went to [[Abel]] escorted by soldiers, identified the object, and had the next couple of days to relax.
> I really needed it!

So what was it?
> Sorry, cannot tell you.

(End of discussion)

Why soldiers?
> It was official [[Loures]] business. I could have handled it myself, but they insisted. The natives of [[Abel Beach]] must of thought it was strange seeing me with [[Loures]] soldiers.

///// PATH 2 /////

[[Erika]]
\*Compliment her*
> Thank you. Will you get to the point, please?

*(End of the discussion)*

\*Tell her of the dreams of the boy and the old man\*
> I see... I am not good at interpreting dreams, but I think I know what that is about. There was an old legend that said something like that.
> But it was always seen as only that, a legend.

What is the legend?
> It was never written down, so I know little of it. It said a poor man once did something very good, so [[Danaan]] rewarded him with a strange cap that made him healthier and wiser. I cannot remember the details... the other gods offered to make his cap stronger, but he declined. After [[Danaan]]'s sacrifice, the gods wondered if they could aid their fighters with similar caps. They argued over it and could not come to an agreement. All this is hearsay, though, and happened hundreds of Deochs ago. But now that I think of it, the coincidences are quite interesting...

What coincidences?
> Recently a soldier of [[Loures]], who worhips here, told me of a girl in the castle having a strange cap. Whenever she wore it, he said, she seemed stronger and her eyes shined. I dismissed him, he was probably just in love with her. Bah, that is probably what it is.

////////////////////

///// PATH 1 /////

[[Ase]]
> Hello.

Nice weather is it not?
> Sure is, it is always sunny here.

Many warriors fighting lately?
> Yeah, some.

Have you seen anything unusual lately?
> Soldiers from [[Loures]], gods from [[Kadath]], [[Aislings]] from... Sheesh.
> What is next, [[Ainmeal]] will come back from the dead and tell me I am his rightful heir?

Soldiers?
> Yes, a handful of soldiers came from [[Loures]] looking from something. I do not know what is was, nor did I care at the moment. But now I am intrigued.

Gods?
> Well, one god, actually, [[Fiosachd]]. I found it very strange, because, of all gods, the patron of [[Rogue|Rogues]] should be the most careful about not being seen. But he seemed quite worried, came running along the beach like his immortal life depended on it. Guess he was looking for whatever the soldiers came to get. I did not ask, I am no [[Aislings|Aisling]] to talk to gods in person.

[[Ainmeal]]?
> Or maybe it will be [[Tenes]]. Or [[Ealagad]].

[[Tenes]]? [[Ealagad]]?
> Never heard of them? Oh really, shame on you! Go read the history of [[Temuair]], urgently! What kind of [[Aislings|Aisling]] are you if you do not know of those three?

///// PATH 2 /////

[[Blanchefleur]]
> My cap? It is very special to me; I feel so much better when I wear it. Oh, here it is.
> The burden of these cold walls seems lighter when I put it on.

\[This dialog tree goes nowhere]
Give me the cap.
> Give it to you? Of course not! It was a gift, and I like it very much. I will not part with it. Do not insist.

\*You leave her alone\*
*(End of discussion)*

I will give you 50,000 coins for the cap.
> You offer me money for my previous cap!? Apologize, and I will pretend I did not hear it.

Sorry
> Very well. Is there anything else you want?

*(back to start of the conversation)*

\*You take the cap and run\*
/You are captured bu the guards and thrown out of the castle/
\[End of the nowhere dialog tree]

Where did you get it?
> It was a gift, but I do not remember from whom. I do remember a sailor that came to visit me the other day. He said it looked like something they have a tale about over in [[Abel]]. Something involving [[Fiosachd]]. But it sounded too much like a silly big city legend, and he was such a bad storyteller...Besides, he brought no gifts from the outside world.
> I paid little attention to him.

Gifts from the outside world?
> Ah, yes. Trapped in this lonely castle, I treasure every little thing, sight, scent, or tale from the world beyond this walls. [[Aislings]] such as yourself used to bring me flowers, I loved that so! But they stopped for some reason. Either I am not worthy of flowers anymore, or flowers are not worthy of me. I so wish I could smell them again...

Something involving [[Fiosachd]]?
> Yes, I just told you that. But that is all there is to it. Just to let you know, sometimes my friend [[Aundy]] comes from the temple she lives in, in [[Abel]], and tells me stories fo the big city. I asked her about that, out of curiosity, and she did not know anything. If [[Fiosachd]] has any ties to this pretty cap of mine, and not even his [[Acolyte]] knows it, who would, other than himsef? Of well...You are an [[Aislings]], free to travel across the world. Maybe you can find a way to ask the patron of [[Rogue|Rogues]] himself

////////////////////

[[Fiosachd|Keefe]]
I seek answers...
> What kind of answers?

I seek answers from [[Fiosachd]].
> You address your questions to a god directly? What got into your mind, [[Aislings|Aisling]]? The doubt-solving god is [[Luathas]], not me.

So you will not tell me of the cap?
> Tell you? That is not my problem. I make sure what is supposed to remain hidden, remains. Sometimes I am a bit late, but I can always take it back or hide it somewhere else. I am the God of Chance, things usually work out for me, one way or the other. But I am saying too much. Leave [[Aislings|Aisling]]. i have no further business with you.


[[Luathas|Logan]]
[[Luathas]], the Cap
> You have come far in your search, have you not? But more awaits ahead of you.

More!? But I have been to all corners of [[Temuair]] already!
> I know. That is part of your quest. Do not lose heart, your goal is closer than you imagine.

(End of discussion)

I am eager to continue, I wish to help the boy.
> Yes, the boy in [[Abel]]. I am surprised you still remember he was the first step of this endless walk. Helping the boy is the largest of the tasks.
> There are many others.

What will I gain in the end?
> If you complete these tasks, your reward will be that which you have pursued all this time.

What must I do next?
> You must first track your prize's origins. You are close. The torturous path that you seek lies in damp marshes beyond this mountains. Look for information there, but rememeber, as [[Deoch]] has great goodness behind his dark figure, important information may be hidden behind what seems ignorant.
> My role in your epic pursuit is done. Go now, may the [[Light]] of [[Danaan]] guide you.


[[Beggar (Mehadi)]]
*(out loud)* Cousin
> I'm a busy man, how much is my time worth to you?

How about 1,000 gold coins?
> Good, thanks a lot. What do you want with me?

Nothing, just felt like being kind today.
> That's nice. I hope you are always in the area when that happens. Are you sure there is nothing else?

Looking for this cap.
> That thing is causing so much trouble. I had no idea such a simple looking piece of clothing could have so much linked to it. But I am not surprised. Let me tell you, a man can only trust two things in his life, death and his dog.
> I wouldn't be here if I knew that at your age.

What happened that brought you there
> I am so glad you asked! It all began when I lived in [[Rucesion]]. I had this shop that I inherited from my father, and...
> You spend some time listening to the man's tale and learn some good things!

Where did you get the cap?
> I found it half buried in the mud after a heavy rain. I don't know how it got there, though; Maybe it had been there for a long time, or maybe the river brought it. So I gave it to my cousin, to see if he would have better luck in selling it. As you see, it did not work. That wandering fool...
> Now, the cap, I am sure there was something strange about it...

Something strange?
> Yes! Because even with all that mud, all it took was a quick splash and it was brand new, clean and shiny, as if sewn a moment before. I think it might be the work of those [[Mukul]] people. Some of them might know more about it, you should go mention the cap to them. That thing is magical I tell you. Too bad no one cared to buy it from a beggar.


[[Varuna]]
*(out loud)* The Cap
> You are making too much noise. I will help you if it will make you stop. But I want something in return.
> I hope you know what it is.

I have what you need. *(a viper's gland)*
> Good, I know what it is you seek. We saw it when the river brought it, and when it was taken away by your kind.
> Then I dreamed of [[Matrika]], she told me one of your kind would come after it, and told me what to do. No deity, yours or ours, will guide you to what you pursue.
> You must hear the voice of the gods when they speak in one's dream.

But the boys could not understand the dreams.
> Then you must seek one who can, or could.

I see... the old man who wrote the book [[Blaise]] spoke about.
> I do not know who you speak of, but if you think it is him you must seek, then find him.
> Many spirits roam in a dark land. Some can be called back. Find the one who wields such power: the power to summon those who already crossed the line life. But be warned: he lets no mistake go unpunished, and for big issues there are big penalties.


[[Greim]]
Greim, talk to the dead
> What do you need?

I must speak to one who has left this land.
> Foolish mortal, dare you think it is so easily arranged?
> One cannot tear open he fabric of realms without facing the consequences.

I prefer not to meddle with these things.
> Then leave.

*(End of the discussion)*

What consequences?
> An open rift such as that will not close until it has dragged enough energy into itself.
> The soul blind enough to open it without proper care my be forever lost in its depth.

Forever? No, thanks.
> All in due time...

*(End of the discussion)*

What is the proper care?
> In decay there is great energy - that is what I deal in. Bring me a token of that, and I might be able to close it for you.
> If it is left open I may lose some fresh souls...and would have to find a way to replace them.

I changed my mind.
> Be gone.

*(End of the discussion)*

I am willing to try
> Very well.

\[You get sent to the [[Hall of Souls]]]
[[Dreamer]]
> Welcome, I have been expecting you.

Who are you?
Am I dead?
What is this place?
> I understand you have many questions, but there is not enough time to answer all of them. Let me put it this way: you are in a spirit form, but unable to return.
> We are in a right created between the realms of dead and living. I am the one who first had the dreams that now haunt the young boy in [[Abel]]. I was keeping a record of those dreams, but when I finally understood it - when the words of the gods became clear - I could not handle it.
> Eight deities speaking at the same time, a mere [[Mundanes|mundande]] was not made to face that. And here is where I ended up.
> But I do remember what they said.

And what was that?
> It was a long story, I will try to make it short. One day, a tragic accident happened, and a young girl nearly lost her life. She was saved by a poor man, but that act cost him his own health. Seeing that, [[Danaan]] rewarded him with a cap. When he wore it, he became healthier again. That was the Cap of [[Danaan]]
> The other deities offered to make the cap more powerful, but the man declined, being alive and healthy was enough for him.
> So the matter was put aside and forgotten

What happened to the Cap of [[Danaan]]?
> It is said [[Fiosachd]] hid it, so no one unworthy would wear it. After [[Danaan]]'s sacrifice, however, the gods wished to hand it to their fighters, the [[Aislings]], to aid in their battle. They would keep the original, of course, but grand the [[Aislings]] Caps of equal power.
> The same offer they made to the poor man, will be offered to the [[Aislings]], each deity can add different powers to the Cap.

But these caps were never seen!
> That is true. Four gods - [[Fiosachd]], [[Gramail]], [[Deoch]] and [[Sgrios]] - did not want to simply hand them freely to the [[Aislings]]. They wanted proof of their loyalty to [[Light]].
> So the Caps were withheld until they had such proof.

There is such proof now?
> Yes. The victory of the Champion and Diciples of [[Light]] over their [[Darkness|Dark]] counterparts was that proof. The gods then agreed to give the [[Aislings]] the Caps.
> But something unexpected happened, and they were delayed.

What happened?
> It is not known how, but the original Cap of [[Danaan]] disappeared from it's hiding place. This greatly distressed the gods, and they decided to find a better place to hide it, but under more subtle methods.
> A vision from the [[Acolyte]] of [[Gramail]], the honor of some [[Loures|Lourian]] soldiers, the ability of some sneaky thief and his bad luck as he went through the swamp, the "live for the moment" philosophy of a beggar, the love of an arena guard, the endurance of a trapped lady. And the original Cap of [[Danaan]] is safe again.

And why did the boy have those dreams?
> For two reasons. First, because of some of the things [[Gods|gods]] do cannot be explained by each [[Acolyte]] in separate, that is why they try to speak to mortals in their dreams.
> And second, because they finally decided to hand the [[Aislings]] the Caps, and needed a...lure.

A lure?
> Yes. This gigantic ordeal you went through, this was part of your test, to know if you are worthy of the Cap of [[Danaan]]. It is not the most powerful of items, but it was conceived from the Light of [[Danaan]] itself. The gods needed to be sure no one unworthy would wear it. So far, you have proven your worth.
> But one more task is ahead of you.

It is still not over!?
> No, There is one more thing for you to do, you must match the poor man's goodness to receive equal benefit. Seek the Avatar [[Ceannlaidir|father]] or the [[Cail|son]], either will guide you through the last step. That is all.
> Oh you must be curious why the gods decided to let the [[Blanchefleur|girl in Loures]] keep the Cap. Well... The young girl saved by the poor man, long ago, she grew up lovely and had a daughter, whom she named [[Blanchefleur]].
> Goodbye.

Wait, I have more questions!
> Before you finish your sentence, you find yourself back in the inn. But something this absurdly long and complex could not possibly have been a dream. You should go seek "the Avatar father or the son", as the spirit told you so.

////// PATH A ///////

[[Cail|Donnan]]
Are you the son I seek?
> Yes, I am. Your goal is close. But there are two very simple tasks you must complete before you can have the Cap.
> Do you accept it?

Sorry, I am sick of this story already.
> Did I hear that right?

No
