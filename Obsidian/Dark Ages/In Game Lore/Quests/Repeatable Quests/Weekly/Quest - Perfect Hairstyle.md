"The Perfect Hairstyle"
> Good sun to you, [[Aislings|Aisling]]. Say! \*leans over the counter* What do you think of my hair?

"Er...it's lovely"
> \*Dramatic sigh* You have no spark for style, I see. Nevermind then.
> \[[[Eeva]] gives you a bored look.]

*End of conversation*

"It's a bit bland to be honest"
> Ah! An honest [[Aislings|Aisling]]! I like you already.
> \[She gives you a bright smile.]
> I've been watching tenants coming in and leaving, and I've narrowed the selections down to a few styles I really want to try. But I need some items...and as you know, I can't very well leave my inn abandoned.

"Sorry, I have bigger things to worry about."
> A snooty [[Aislings|Aisling]] as well, I see.
> \[[[Eeva]] turns her back on you in a huff.]

*End of conversation*

"I'd love to help. What do you need?"
> Thank you so much! Now...which do you like best?

[[Hairstyle Book]]
"Done"
> TODO

*End of conversation*

> Ah! back already? So which hairstyle did you think was best?

"Can I look at the book again?"
[[Hairstyle Book]]

"\[A hairstyle]"
> Oh excellent choice, you have good taste! Did you bring what's necessary?

"Oops...I'll be right back!"
> \[[[Eeva]] frowns at you with disappointment.]

"Yes I did" (without the items)
> Hmm? I don't think you have all of the items needed yet. Come back when you have them.

"Yes I did" (with the items)
> Excellent! Thank you so much! I couldn't have done it without your help. Take this as my thanks!
> \[[[Eeva]] thanks you and applies the new style.] ~={orange}(lies)=~
