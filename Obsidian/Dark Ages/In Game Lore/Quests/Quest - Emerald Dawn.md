Notes:
- The Aosda mentioned is the first because it mentions how they got corrupted with Kadath and all.

[[Mioas]]
> Greetings, Ainsling!
> I have traveled far and wide, and have many tales to tell you. First, I would like to tell you of one of my most recent travels.
> I ventured into the [[Abel Crypt]], five levels below, and met with the [[Dwarves|dwarven]] blacksmith they call [[Ake]]. He told me a tale of the time of the [[First Aosda|Aosda]].
> Long ago, a young warrior lass named [[Mida]] lived an exquisite life. Her father was the richest man in the [[First Aosda|Aosda]] civilization. She was set to lead the city-states to glory when her father died. She was his only heir.
> [[Mida]] did not seek a life of political dominance, though. [[Mida]] sought to learn the way of the sword to protect her townsfolk from the evil that was brewing in [[Temuair|Earth-Sea]].
> When the time came for [[Mida]]'s father to pass from this world into the next, Mida defied her father's dying wishes to lead the people around her. She instead chose to join a small group of fighters who called themselves Smarag Ridir -- the [[Emerald Knights]].
> [[Mida]] worked with the [[Emerald Knights]] to keep the peace in the times of madness that ensued. But more and more of the [[First Aosda|Aosdan]] scholars reached out towards the dimness of [[Kadath]], and returned from the gate either hideously mutated, or mad beyond reason.
> The [[Emerald Knights]] eventually found that the only way to stop the growing corruption in [[Temuair|Earth-Sea]] was to venture to the gates of [[Chaos]] and seal it forever. The [[Emerald Knights|Knights]] made alliances with the [[Druids of Balance|druids of balance]], who harnessed magic to create and empower life, and the [[Necromancers]], who harnessed magic to create and empower undead, soul-less constructions.
> The [[Emerald Knights]] journied to [[Chaos]], battled, and sealed it with some ancient power. None of the [[Emerald Knights]] returned.
> A book was eventually found here in Suomi, nearly a thousand years later, with a full family history of each of the Knights. It was found that one of the Knights who perished in battle, [[Mida]] herself, had a child before her death.
> The information on who [[Mida]]'s child was has been hidden from all for many years. I am confident an heir to the legacy still resides in [[Temuair]]. The bloodline of the [[Emerald Knights|Knights]] has a reputation for breeding superior warriors.
> *she pauses for a few seconds*
> Alas, that is all I know of this tale. Perhaps you could try to find out more on your own.

[[Berg]]

> The [[Emerald Knights]]? Aye, I have heard of them.
> I don't know anything, and if I did, why would I trust you with the information? You could be one of them.
> If you want anything out of me, you'll have to prove your allegiance to the [[Emerald Knights|Knights]]. Journey to the first 5 areas of [[Shinewood Forest]] and find an [[Emerald Knights|Emerald Knight]] Insignia. Beware, though -- the insignia will only reveal itself to the worthy.

> Astounding! You Aislings truly are a rare breed. I will tell you all that I know.
> [[Mida]], the [[Emerald Knights]], the [[Necromancers]] and the [[Druids of Balance|Druids]] gathered and walked towards the gate of [[Chaos]]. Once inside, they initiated combat with the creatures inside.
> The [[Emerald Knights|Knights]] were proving successful in repelling the forces of [[Chaos]] long enough to seal the gate. But the [[Necromancers]] gathered in secret and proposed a different plan.
> The [[Necromancers]], seeing these monsters as an astounding unnatural force, eventually opposed the plan to seal the gate. They reanimated the corpses of the slain monsters, creating a military force of skeletons and other monstrosities.
> When the [[Emerald Knights]] and the [[Druids of Balance|Druids]] refused to allow [[Chaos]] to stay open, the [[Necromancers]] turned on their allies, slaying them all. The druids spoke to the [[Temuair|Earth-Sea]] and whispered to their brothers outside of the tragedy that had occurred. They took [[Mida]]'s child into hiding. 
> The [[Necromancers]] did not expect the creatures they had reanimated to retain their evil souls, however, and once the [[Druids of Balance|Druids]] ans [[Emerald Knights]] were slain, the monsters reverted to their normal mindset, slaying what was left of the small force of [[Necromancers]]. Some escaped, using their necromantic magic to reanimate their dying bodies.
> The [[Necromancers]] went into hiding from that day forth, and so did the [[Druids of Balance|Druids]]. The [[Necromancers]] were not to be seen again, not until long after the fall of [[First Aosda|Aosdan]] civilization and the creation of the [[Aislings|Spark]]. They would not rise to power again until [[Tagor]] unveiled itself from the mists.
> Ever since that day the [[Druids of Balance|Druids]] and the [[Necromancers]] have been at odds. We have succeeded in keeping [[Mida]]'s bloodline safe for many years, however, recently, one of the children of the bloodline refused to be taken into protection. The woman known as [[Dalil]] raised her son without giving any of us information. We don't even know what he looks like.
> This Insignia may be able to help you find the heir to the [[Emerald Knights]]. Reveal his destiny to him, but be careful -- If the [[Necromancers]] find out about the heir, they may try to stop you and finish off the bloodline once and for all.


[[Gans]] - [[Druids of Balance]] (?)

> My father had one of these when i was a child. He tried to keep it hidden from me, but I eventually stumbled upon it.
> This is the insignia of the [[Emerald Knights]]? I wonder why my father had it...
> Sorry, I must be on my way now. We do have a war to win, after all.

[[Skan]] - Rogues idk
> That is a very unique item you have there. Where did you find it?
> Ah, I've heard of the [[Emerald Knights]]. A [[Mioas|Bard]] told me the tale of the [[Emerald Knights|Knights]] when I was in [[Suomi]].
> I would very much like to have such a rare item. Would you sell it to me? I offer one million gold coins.

Refused
> I see. If you change your mind, the offer is still on the table.

[[Dislaidir]] - [[Mida]]'s heir

> Where did you find that?!
> I see. You have traveled far and wide in search of the heir to the [[Emerald Knights]]?
> Yes, I am the son of [[Dalil]].

Blah...blah...blah...
> The story you have told me is incredible. I am to be the heir of the [[Emerald Knights]]? This is a very odd thing you have told me, but I am compelled to believe you.
> I was visited in my dreams by [[Luathas]]. He told me that the knowledge of my ancestry would be revealed to me shortly. First, I took it for just a dream, but now...
> If you will give me that insignia, I will use it to reunite those who would fight in the name of all that is good and justified. I will once again forge the order of the [[Emerald Knights]].

Refused
> I see. Thank you for your research, if nothing else.

Accept
> I thank you. Your research and intuition has led me to my destiny!


[[Sennaan]] - [[Necromancers]] order
> The insignia of the [[Emerald Knights]]! Where did you get this?!
> The [[Emerald Knights]] are sewer scum, evil [[Aislings]] that would seal you out of [[Temuair]] if they had the chance. If you would give the insignia to me, the order of [[Necromancers]] will surely reward you.

Refuse
> Fine, do as you will.
> Should you choose to give the Insignia to me, I will gladly take it in the future. For now, I must report these findings to the order.

Give
> Finally! I shall be rewarded greatly for your efforts, [[Aislings|Aisling]]. *he cackles maniacally*
> Here you go. Don't spend it all in one place!

Notes :
Why is [[Dislaidir]] in a graveyard and gives the quest to create a pet zombie at Halloween???
[[Gans]] has no link with the [[Druids of Balance]], is there another end to the quest?
Why does [[Luathas]] an Aosdan, pushes Dislaidir towards this destiny when her mother didn't want to? If he even is the true heir.
Gans did say his father had a similar insignia and looks way much more like a Knight
