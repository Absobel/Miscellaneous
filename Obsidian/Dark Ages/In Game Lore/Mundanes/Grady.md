[[Muisir Village]]

> Hello. What can I do for you?

Muisir VIllage
> Greetings! You seemed confused?

> How did I get here?

> You walked through the tiny cave I'm wondering...

> Yes, but what is this place?

> This is [[Muisir Village]]. We are peaceful [[Aislings]] that value all creatures and nature.

> That sounds very familiar...

> It should be. The God [[Cail]] created this peaceful land for his daughter, [[Amena]].
> He named her [[Amena]] because it represents honesty and pure.

> Is that a statue of her?

![[Amena Statue.png]]

> Yes it is.
> [[Cail]]'s goal was to shield [[Amena]] from all the harm and danger outside [[Muisir Village]].
> [[Cail]] did succeed until one day [[Amena]] disappeared...
> That statue is not to worship [[Amena]], but to mourn her disappearance.

> Does anyone have a clue where she went or who took her?

> Not that I know of, but there is one villager that she is close to... maybe he might know a thing or two.

> Do you know his name?

> Sorry, I can't seem to remember his name...
> I can tell you this, once [[Amena]] disappeared, it threw [[Muisir Village]] off-balance. It's not as peaceful as it was before. In fact, some of the creatures has become hostile.
> We even created a training group to help [[Aislings]] fend for themselves.
> If you want, you ca go there to familiarize yourself with the area.
> Just let me know, and I will send you to [[Tiernan]].


Muisir Training Grounds:
> Oh... you are ready to train so soon?

> Yes, I'm excited to train.

> Okay, this training might be too easy for you. I can sense that you are a seasoned fighter.

> Amusing...

> The training will also give you a chance to explore our land.
> You probably never seen any buildings or flowers of this type before.

> That is correct. This place is quite different from what I'm used to.

> Okay, you should see [[Tiernan]] in a second.
> Have fun.
