Theology of the [[Gods of Temuair#Octagram|Octagram]] *(TODO: verify jean spelling of octagram)*
> As you may know, this cycle matches the order of the [[Gods of Temuair|Gods]] on the [[Gods of Temuair#Octagram|Octagram]] when traced from point to point towards the center. The entire octogram may be inscribed by a stylus without lifting it. The last line of the eight-pointed star ends at the beginning of the first point.

Where can I learn more?
> Ask the shrine attendants of one of the eight shrines. Also read the works in the [[Works read|Loures Library]] and in other libraries on the gods.
