> Ah, I'm not the only one that has seen the Tiny Cave.
> Let me guess, you tried to squeeze yourself through the entrance?

> No, I didn't try that yet.

> It's not a good idea, i've already tried it with no luck.

> Can you help me get inside?

> Sure. I can whip up any potion to suit your needs.

> What do you need from me?

> Since, it's a simple potion, all I need is 5 [[Undine]] Mushrooms. They used to be a rare type of mushroom, but suddenly they've been sprouting up only at this village. If you're lucky you will find several just outside that door.

> Okay, I'll be right back.

...

> I told you it wasn't that had to collect.
> Now go explore that cave! I gave you enough potion to explore the area several times.
