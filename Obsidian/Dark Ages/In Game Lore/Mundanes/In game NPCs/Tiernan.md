> Hello. What can I do for you?

About Muisir Hunting Grounds
> You must be interested in training. You look so serious.

> Yes! I'm interested in what this training is about.

> Well, we managed to gather some of the mushrooms that went rogue.

> You can train on them and gain experience at the same time.

> Excellent. I'll practice my skills on these little guys until I'm ready for the big-leagues.

> Yeah...practice on these guys first. The bigger guys are a bit tough.
> As you probably noticed, there are 4 entrances. Each guarded by my brothers. The monster gets progressively harder.
> To continue through the course, you have to complete the training in a specific order \*weakest to hardest\*
> You can tell the difficulty of the entrance by my brothers' name.
> To complete the training, follow the order: [[Tadhg]] -> [[Taliesin]] -> [[Teariach]] -> [[Teilo]]
> Each entrance has it's own rules and requirements. If you don't pass one of the training, you have to start all over from the beginning.
> I'll guide you to my first brother [[Tadhg]]. He can explain more.
