> Greetings, what are you doing on this island? No one has ever visited this land before.
> My name is Anwar, I am a farmer here. I grow produce and sell them at the [[Loures]] market. This place has the best soil.
> So, what brings you to this desolate place? Exploring, eh? Well you picked the wrong place to be exploring. Some strange things lies within the heart of this island, evil things. It is best you stay on the outskirts.
> That's why i'm the only farmer here, the others are too frightened to come. You would be too if you knew the history.
> Do you want to here it, the story of this place?
