[[Excavation Camp]]

[[Quest - Explore Deadwood Forest]]
> Mundane archaeologists have just uncovered an ancient castle. We believe it is the castle [[Beal na Carriage]].
> Not much known about the castle except that it was once a watch tower, keeping an eye on any invaders coming from the south seas.
> We have set up an [[Excavation Camp|excavation camp]] here, near the castle. We have already uncovered most of the castle's exterior and we are preparing to explore the interior.
> If you have the time, we actually need your help. With all our attention on the castle, we haven't had much time exploring the surrounding forest, or what's left of it.
> We know that i was once part of [[Shinewood Forest]], but something caused all of the trees and grass to die. This area is now known as [[Deadwood Forest]].
> We need to explore each area of [[Deadwood Forest]] except for the castle site and the excavation camp.
