Offer Viper's gland
> What shall you learn?

Tell me about you
> I am a [[Vibha]]. We know the numbers. We know the history of the [[Mukul]], the times of the ceremonies. We are the chroniclers of [[Mukul]]. We chronicle by generations of [[Mukul]]. We begin with the first generation of [[Mukul]] alive when [[Natesh]], the sixth god, was born.

(costed one viper's gland each)

> 1st [[Natesh]]  [[Natesh]] was born. [[Natesh]] is the sixth god. He was born with five other nameless gods and horrible creature. Each is evil, but [[Natesh]] vows to protect the [[Mukul]] from them.
> I've talked enough about [[Mukul]] culture to an outsider

> 3rd [[Natesh]]   [[Natesh]] demanded offering. [[Natesh]] demanded that [[Mukul]] make an offering to him. We, the [[Vibha]], remember the exact times and what the offering must be.
> I've talked enough about [[Mukul]] culture to an outsider.

> 16th [[Natesh]]  [[Natesh]] demands the [[Tulsi Mela]]. Natesh demanded the Tulsi from the Mukul. We now perform a ceremony to provide Natesh with that sacred flower. Natesh says his heart must be rekindled by the flower.

> 17th Natesh  [[Tirtha Chandi]]. Rebels of the [[Ford]]. Mukul society is a unified river. The [[Tirtha Chandi]] left the society en masse. They would not make the [[Tulsi Mela]] sacrifice to [[Natesh]].

> 23rd Natesh   [[Matrika]] sacrificed herself. Matrika sacrificed herself os that the Mukul may later have a savior from the five gods ~={orange}(which?)=~ and the horror.

> 23rd Natesh   [[Great Ratri Mela]]. We make the greatest Tulsi sacrifice ceremony in this generation.

> 28th Natesh   [[The Last Ratri]]. The Destruction. If we do not appease [[Natesh]], it will be the last Ratri. The Ratri will wipe out all of the Mukul, as the [[Jivanta]] will tell you.
