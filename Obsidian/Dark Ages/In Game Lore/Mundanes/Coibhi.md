[[Chadul]] Army Invasion
> The [[Druids of Balance|Order of Druids]] have sent brothers into the depths of the cursed [[The Underworld|realm of Chadul]] himself. There, it was discovered a plot by the god of [[Chaos]] to invade the lands of [[Temuair]]. He is rallying an army of dark [[Aislings]], and he had his [[Dubhaim|dubhaimd]] agents assist with recreating several villages for training. Please, for the sake of the innocent and infirm, take the hidden path within the depths of Chadul's Realm to cut down his soldiers and forestall the invasion. We may not have much time before the war against the [[Darkness|darkness]] begins anew.
