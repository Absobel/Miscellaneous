From [[Jean]]:

> The Cycle of Becoming is the flow of one [[Gods of Temuair|god]] into another, nominally beginning with [[Deoch]] and ending with [[Sgrios]], although it is completely cyclical.

Theology of the Octave in Years
> Deoch 1        Year of [[Deoch]]
> Deoch 2        Year of [[Glioca]]
> Deoch 3        Year of [[Cail]]
> Deoch 4        Year of [[Luathas]]
> Deoch 5        Year of [[Gramail]]
> Deoch 6        Year of [[Fiosachd]]
> Deoch 7        Year of [[Ceannlaidir]]
> Deoch 8        Year of [[Sgrios]]
> This cycle repeats, so Deoch 9 is Year of [[Deoch]], Deoch 10 is Year of [[Glioca]], and so on.
> This cycle also seems to correspond to the time before Deoch 1, so that the year before Deoch 1 was the Year of [[Sgrios]], and so on.

At the new year is the [[Conjunction]]
