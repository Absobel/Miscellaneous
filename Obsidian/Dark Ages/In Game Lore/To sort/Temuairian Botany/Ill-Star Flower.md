![[Ill-Star Flower.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> A seven-petaled stubby flower that lays close to the ground is a flower on which there is much lore. It is known as the "Ill-star Flower", and dates back to the says after the drowning of [[Hy-brasyl]].
> When the first [[Ill-star|ill-star]] fell from the skies over [[Hy-brasyl|Hy-Brasyl]], legend says, the star fell to the earth and took root as this vile weed. It is quite a prolific plant, quite commonly found in the woods of [[Mileth|Finach]].
> It almost certainly obtained its "evil" reputation from the fact that the flowers emit a vile, disorienting stench instead of the standard sweet aroma one would expect. This scent is the plant's way to attract flies to pollinate it, preferring them to bees.
