From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> Ever wonder how light makes it deep in the dungeons of the world? The [[Dwarves]] have a unique solution. They grow a luminous vine the call 'Lochran Tendrils' in the depths of their homes.
> The bloom is a brilliant little sphere of light. [[Throttler]] kindly demonstrated the plant's other use to me.
> When the flower's light is released, it blinds the nuisance standing before one. Should the blinding light fail, stomping on their feet, throwing one's ale into their face, and beating upon the shins seems to be the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] custom.
