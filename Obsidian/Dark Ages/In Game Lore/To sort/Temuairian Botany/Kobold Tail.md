![[Kobold Tail.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:

> The children of [[Undine]] sing a simple song about a pink fuzzy flower on purple leaf and stem common in the area:
>
> [[Kobold]] Tail, Kobold Tail,
> Once so pretty and very pale,
> Once so vibrant and verdant green,
> The loveliest plant ever seen,
> Stained by the blood of the [[Caroun]],
> Reddened under a [[Red Moon|crimson moon]].
> 
> Fear not, the forces of [[Loures]] will make safe the citizens of [[Undine]] yet. Perhaps then this 'Kobod Tail' flower will be renamed.
