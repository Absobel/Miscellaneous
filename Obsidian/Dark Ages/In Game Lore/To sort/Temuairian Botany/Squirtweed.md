From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> With the recent use of [[Breath Ring|Breath Rings]], the bizarre world of underwater plants has become known in greater detail. A very strange plant that does not seem like it belongs under the sea grows there nonetheless.
> It produces small berries instead of blooms. The bulb where one would expect the bud to appear is instead filled with sea water. The water encased within jets out of the plant with the slightest pressure.
> More than this i cannot say, for all my specimens for study have been stolen by children who have dubbed the plant 'Squirtweed' for obvious reasons.
