![[Lily Pads.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> In the [[Mehadi Swamp|swamps of Mehadi]] the [[Mukul]] reevere the frogs of the life-giving waters. Lily pads are grown in the heart of the swamp to provide thrones for their holy amphibians to rest upon, providing respite.
> Perhaps the magic of the swamps can be transferred to [[Aislings|Aislingkind]] as well.
