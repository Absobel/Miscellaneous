From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> Certain cactus of the deserts of [[Medenia]] bloom only for one short night. With such a short window for reproduction, they bloom magnificent large blossoms.
> These opulent blooms emit a strong and sweet aroma in their desperate attempt to attract pollinators. Such extravagant beauty is rare, these 'Cactus Flowers' are prizes, indeed.
