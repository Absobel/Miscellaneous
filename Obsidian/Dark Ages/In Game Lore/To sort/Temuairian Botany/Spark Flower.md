![[Spark Flower.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> A simple leaved plant with a single stalk adorned with a multitude of small white blooms is reported to have been found, but I could find no ancient lore on such a flower.
> This flower, therefore, is a recent discovery of the depths of the [[West Woodlands|Western Woods]]. [[Throttler]] the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] has told me that the [[Wisps]] and [[Faerie|Fae]] that reside there have told him much of this flower over his home-brewed mead.
> The [[Wisps]] say that when a being of pure light dies, it does not fade into darkness, for [[Light]] cannot be [[Darkness]]. Thus when the goddess [[Danaan]] gave her life to rid the lands of [[Chadul]], her light was not snuffed, but shattered into a thousand thousand tiny points of light.
> These sparks of light radiated over the lands. The [[Faerie|Fae]] say that this plant, not wanting the life-giving light to be lost forever, stretched a stem up into the air and caught the light as flowers on its stalk.
> Thus the denizens of the woods dubbed the flower 'Sparkflower', or more commonly, 'Sparkweed', as the plant is in fact a freely-growing wildflower.
