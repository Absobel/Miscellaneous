From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> A particular fern is found in the [[East Woodlands|Eastern Woodlands]]. The [[Tuatha de Danaan|tuatha]] called them 'raineach'.
> The [[Faerie|Fae]] of the woods are said to use these fronds to fan favorable winds upon their loved ones. Oh how I remember days gone by, resting in the vales of the wood, watching the [[Faerie|faeries]] flutter to and fro waving these frond fans whimsically to each other.
> I was lucky enough to be caught in one such gust in my youth. I must admit, a most refreshing breeze comes from waving these leaves.
