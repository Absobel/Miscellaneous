From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> Legend has it that a man high in the Court of [[Loures]] held the heart of a maid of the [[Loures Castle|Castle]]. The maid was convinced this man shared the same feelings for her, for he showered her with gifts, flowers and poems charged with passion.
> Deochs padded and this forbidden love blossomed. The maid was drunk on love. She began to grow weary though, of hiding their happiness.
> Finally, she decided to confront the man with her troubles. He grew silent. His visits to her became less frequent. She began to worry.
> One day, the mad suddenly charged into her chamber. He grabbed her, embracing her. Almost as suddenly as they hugged, the man stepped back.
> Taking a breath, he let her know that he was engaged to be married to a woman of high royal status from another land and has been engaged for well over a Deoch.
> Horrified, the maid asked 'But.. what about us?' Quickly, he pushed her to the floor, warning her never to mention their affair. 'There will never be 'us' ' he coldly stated. The heartbroken maid asked him why.
> Why had he toyed with her heart? He laughed slightly. 'There never was 'us' ' He was in it for the thrills. Playing with her hearts deepest emotions like an instrument, a hobby he could pick up and throw down as he pleased.
> The woman lay still on the ground, staring in disbelief. He walked over, knelt down, and kissed the top of her head. He left her quarters, not knowing nor caring of what would happen later that night.
> The heartsick woman tried to sleep. She tossed and turned. She cried... oh how she did weep. Finally she stood. Over to her tiny dresser she went. A vase of wilted flowers, the last gift from him to her, sat, mocking her.
> Closing her eyes, she opened the drawer. Feeling around, she found what she was looking for. In a few quick movements, she could feel the life pouring from her veins.
> Finally, she opened her eyes and on the flowers she found her gaze. Dazed, she laughed, noticing her blood had sprayed the flowers. 'There never was an 'us' ....' she murmured, as she fell to the floor.
> Morning came, the body was discovered. No one knew the reason of this suicide, except one man. He said nothing, of course. To top off the betrayal, he was married that day.
> 	...And the bride was given a wilted bouquet.
