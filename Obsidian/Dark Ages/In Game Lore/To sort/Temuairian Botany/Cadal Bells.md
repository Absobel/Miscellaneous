![[Cadal Bells.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> In the [[Shinewood Forest|forest of Shinewood]], fallen trees can be found covered in clusters of tiny mushrooms. The songs lilting in the air of Shinewoods tell that when a mighty tree falls, the [[Faerie|faeries]] of the woods gather and ring a melancholy tune of mourning on tiny [[Faerie|faerie]] bells.
> These bells can be seen as the caps of these mushrooms, which are said by the [[Faerie|Fae]] to soothe the restless spirit of the fallen wood in order to prevent the tree rising again as a [[Cursed Tree]].
> Mushrooms touched by [[Faerie|faerie]] magic are doubly dangerous. Great care should be used when handling these fungal blooms.
