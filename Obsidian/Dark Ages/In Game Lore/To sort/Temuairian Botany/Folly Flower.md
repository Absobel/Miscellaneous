From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]
> Ships from [[Medenia]] have brought back a bloom full of blooms, vibrant and enthusiastic in habit and color. A tragic tale from that far-off land is attached to this bloom.
> The story goes that in the plains of [[Noam]] there lived a young man who loved a beautiful woman. This youth sought long and hard to find the perfect gift to express his love.
> He came upon this flower with its multitude of blooms, more than any other flower he had ever seen. He plucked the flower from the fertile plains and presented it to his love as a token of his affection.
> The lady began sneezing violently when presented this bloom, for its pollen was overflowing. The lady dismissed the youth without delay.
> Thus this plant earned the name 'Folly Flower'. It grows unplucked all over the plains now, for the tale attached to this plant taught the people of [[Noam]] that more is not always better.
