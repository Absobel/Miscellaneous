From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> A midnight blue flower blossoming on a pure black stalk. This must be the sorrowful 'Ao-dochas Bloom', the flower of despair
> This is a plant tha thrives and blooms only in utter darkness. Only in lands where hope has faded and darkness reigns can such a plant be found.
> Take great care when you spy such a flower upon the ground, for hope has forsaken the very soil upon which you tread.

Found in [[Filth Forest]] and [[Tagor]] Village
