From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> [[Medenia]] is a strange land. A plant commonly found around the [[Asilon]] region is used in a most peculiar way. It resembles what the [[Tuatha de Danaan|tuatha]] called 'Eidheann', simply ivy.
> The vines are used in addition to a clasping of hands to signify a joining in life, love, or business. Any enterprise undertaken by two parties is sealed with th entwining of this 'Eidheann' plant around the clasped arms of the constituents.
