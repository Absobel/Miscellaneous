![[Bocan Bough.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> A flowering bough of a tree is commonly found on the forest floors of [[Mileth|Finach]]. This, surely, must be the sacred 'Bocan Bough'
> The [[Bocan Tree]] was named by the [[Tuatha de Danaan|tuatha]] after their word for the [[Goblin Horde]]. This tree is the source of the wood these vile creatures use to craft their Wooden Clubs, Spiked Clubs and Hatchet handles.
> As such it is a very important and revered tree in [[Goblins|Goblin]] culture. These boughs are used, as I understand it, to issue challenges between warriors of the [[Goblins|Goblin]] ranks.
> How it is used to such an end I do not know, and I am not about to ask a [[Goblins|Goblin]] to explain it to me.
