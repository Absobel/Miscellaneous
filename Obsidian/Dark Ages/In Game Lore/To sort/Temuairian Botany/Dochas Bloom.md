![[Dochas Bloom.png]]

From [[Temuairian Botany Book]]:
> 'A stately grayish flower standing proud atop a mighty stem.' More description is not needed, this is surely the 'Dochas Bloom', the flower of hope.
> When the armies of [[Rucesion]] descended upon [[Piet]], the townsfolk thought their doom had come. However, the hero [[Tenes]] miraculously led the town to victory, with only minimal damage to the tow.
> After the melee had passed, the [[Piet]] citizenry looked upon the field of battle. Rather than meet with the carnage they had wrought, the townsfolk's eyes met with a multitude of this proud flower waving in the winds.
> They named the flower after their newfound hope for a bright a peaceful future, hope for the resurrection of [[Hy-brasyl|Hy-Brasyl]].
