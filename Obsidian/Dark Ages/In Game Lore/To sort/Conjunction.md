From [[Jean]]

Theology of the Conjunction
> The new year is the transformation. It is the conjunction, where two [[Gods of Temuair|gods]] are indistinguishable.
> Almost all cultures celebrate it. Each recognizes the divine moment: the conjunction.
> For example, the conjunction of [[Deoch]]'s intoxication with [[Glioca]]'s compassion is the birth of love. It is almost like a child. It seems so different from its parents, but it resembles their combined parts.
