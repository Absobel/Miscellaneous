[[Kiril]] translated an [[Aosda|Aosdic]] scroll describing a safe ritual to Ascension written by [[Abhul]]. This scroll belonged to [[Torgny]].

(See [[Abhul]] for the poem)

~={orange}Seems to describe exactly what Deoch and Gramail allows us to do. I didn't read that far yet, but maybe it could set after Deoch went to light but before the second Aosda disappeared?=~

According to [[Huhuman, "The Children of Grinneal"]]:
- There is another form of this ritual, described in [[The Tome of Ascension]]. It is a stronger form needing the altar at the peak of [[Kedarnath]], but allows to ascend to godhood.
- After accumulating great knowledge and experience, it needs making a sacrifice to the [[Earth-Sea Gods]] of [[Kadath]], then if found worthy, they would be granted powers from their accumulated experience (toiseach), and be reborn with more powers, "a god in their own right".
	- [[Luathas]] and [[Fiosachd]] ascended from what seems to be a [[Succubus]] hair.
	- Their mortal being was annihilated by lightning then they were reborn from orbs
- They would then be granted a god-name which would be etched on the altar and would allow believers to make a connection through it
