**FIELD RESEARCH ON [[The Hiss|HISS ENTITY]]: HISS CORRUPTED SECURITY GUARD**

**--CONFIDENTIAL--**

SUMMARY:  
  
The [[Federal Bureau of Control|Bureau]] has many internal security personnel. [[The Hiss]] was quick to take advantage of this fact.  
  
[[Hiss Guard]]s use the standard-issue “bullpup” rifles they carried prior to corruption, while the armored guards carry pump-action shotguns. They have no observed paranatural abilities, with the exception that certain [[Hiss Guard]]s are protected by a shielding of dense [[The Hiss|Hiss]] resonance, capable of stopping bullets. Is this shielding a result of prolonged Hiss corruption? Does [[The Hiss|the Hiss]] mature in organic hosts over time? More data is needed.  
  
Did [[The Hiss|the Hiss]] target individuals with combat training? Does [[The Hiss|the Hiss]] have that level of cognizance? Does it utilize hosts for tasks they are best suited to? Combat-trained hosts are reserved for combat? These are all questions for later, though it is obvious that corrupted individuals retain knowledge on the use of their weapons.
