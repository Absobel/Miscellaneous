[[Federal Bureau of Control]]

Hello,  
  
As you all should know by now, the [[R4 reports]] are due by the end of the week. We're still waiting on them from a number of people. If you need an extension, please request form R4.e from your supervisor. If you think you're exempt from filing an R4, then you'll need to get written permission from your department chief saying so. Remember, R4s are mandatory under section 75.2 of the employee manual.  
  
If your R4 requires inter-departmental claims, then please contact the appropriate department head ([[Dr. Casper Darling|Dr. Darling]], [[Ms. Marshall]], [[Mr. Salvador]], or [[Mr. Kirklund]]) as needed. They'll be busy on Thursday in their annual policy review so please schedule accordingly.  
  
Best,  
  
Your [[Admin Team]]
